# CineLibre - AI-Powered Movie & Book Recommendation System

## Portfolio/Resume Description

**CineLibre** is a full-stack recommendation platform that combines semantic search with collaborative filtering to deliver personalized movie and book suggestions. Built with FastAPI and PostgreSQL (pgvector), the system processes 10,000+ movies across 6 Indian languages and 5,000+ English books using 384-dimensional embeddings generated by FastEmbed. The platform features JWT authentication, real-time interaction tracking, and intelligent TMDB API fallback for dynamic content expansion. Implemented hybrid recommendation algorithms that blend collaborative filtering with content-based approaches, achieving sub-second semantic search responses. Deployed on Koyeb with automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions, the API handles concurrent requests efficiently while maintaining <512MB memory footprint through optimized model loading and thread management.

**Tech Stack**: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, pgvector, FastEmbed, TMDB API, Google Books API, Supabase, Koyeb, GitHub Actions

**Key Features**: Semantic search, collaborative filtering, content-based recommendations, real-time interaction tracking, automated data synchronization, RESTful API with comprehensive documentation
